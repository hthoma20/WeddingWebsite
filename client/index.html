		<p class="covid_update">
			Due to social distancing measures, our plans have changed.
			We canceled our celebrations in Portland and Hawaii, and opted for a small, intimate, and private ceremony.
			We're really sorry that you can't be there, but know that you will be in our thoughts on our special (and unconventional) day.
		</p>
		<p class="covid_update">
			We still want to celebrate with you, just at a later date.
			So (bring your masks and) join us for our one-year anniversary celebration in Hawaii September 2021.
		</p>
